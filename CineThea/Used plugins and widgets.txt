For AJAX:

- I created a bunch of JSON files in json_files directory, and used in events page. The point is: Whenever user clicked to event title, the informations about that event will be shown to user such as image, title and explanation of events.

- Secondly, I send a request to an API, and content will change according to input which will be taken from user. I used this AJAX type in movies page. Thanks to this section, user can search a movie with a word.
